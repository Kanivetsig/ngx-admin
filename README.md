# Admin template based on Angular 4+, Bootstrap 4 and <a href="https://github.com/akveo/nebular">Nebular</a>

Fork of [ngx-admin](https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin/tree/starter-kit)

### What's included:

This is slightly modified version of [ngx-admin](https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin/tree/starter-kit) by [Akveo team](http://akveo.com/) (starter-kit branch).
@nebular/auth was removed and replaced with my own very simple authorization module. A new **Dark** theme based on **Cosmic** was added. 

By default, DemoAuthService is being used so if you want to check it out in action, at login page simple enter any credentials, you will be logged as demo user.
